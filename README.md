In this lab, I demonstrated how an attacker can intercept communication between systems and extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.







\# 🔐 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack using Cain \& Abel



\## 📌 Overview  

This project demonstrates how a \*\*Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack\*\* can be carried out using the \*\*Cain \& Abel\*\* tool.  

An MITM attack intrudes into an existing connection between systems, allowing the attacker to \*\*intercept, read, and manipulate\*\* communication between two parties.



---



\## 🎯 Lab Scenario  

An attacker can obtain sensitive information such as \*\*usernames and passwords\*\* by intercepting packets on a network.  

If the victim authenticates over unsecured websites or public Wi-Fi, the attacker can capture enough data to compromise accounts.  

Examples of potential damage include:  

\- Accessing email or banking accounts  

\- Hijacking sessions  

\- Modifying communication data

\## 🛡️ Preventive Measures  

Organizations and users can defend against MITM attacks by:  

\- Always using \*\*HTTPS\*\* connections on websites  

\- Connecting via a \*\*VPN\*\* when on public networks  

\- Using \*\*SSH tunneling\*\* for remote access  

\- Enforcing strong \*\*authentication \& encryption mechanisms\*\*

\## 🧪 Lab Objectives  

In this lab, I:  

1\. Performed a \*\*Man-in-the-Middle attack\*\* using Cain \& Abel.  

2\. Demonstrated how attackers can capture network packets and extract sensitive data.  

3\. Showed the risk of using insecure protocols in real-world scenarios.  

4\. Highlighted best practices for mitigating MITM threats.

\## 🛠️ Tools Used  

\- \*\*Cain \& Abel\*\* – for packet capturing \& MITM attack simulation  

\- \*\*Windows environment\*\* – to host victim and attacker machines  

\- \*\*VirtualBox / Network setup\*\* – for controlled lab environment
